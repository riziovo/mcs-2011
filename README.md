#Multithreaded Chat Server.
<br/>#an Ode to Yahoo Messenger

<br/>
I developed this software in 2011 with the Java IO API from then. I would like to rewrite it from scratch in future when I find time. Possibly with Netty.

The Chat Server is designed to run on a local server and to allow its every client in the respective network to connect on a chat server running at one end & chat with each other based on TCP/IP Sockets communication. it includes registeration step with a unique username and a password, and basic chat function. The data is held in an MS SQL Server database.
